# Tubular
A project aimed at developing robust methods for mixed-effects modelling of circular data. 
By combining effects that vary on a circular scale with those that vary along the real line,  these models become "[totally tubular](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/(totally)+tubular)". 
A set of ```R``` functions allow these models to be defined and analysed in ```R```, but fitted in ```Stan```via the package ```cmdStanR```.
